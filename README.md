# SA-Script

To you use the Script put the .exe file in the GTA SA Ver. 1.0 Folder after you downgrade the gta-sa.exe file. 

GTA SA Path: ```Steam\SteamApps\common\Grand Theft Auto San Andreas```

When you start up the .exe file it might be blocked by Windows Defender or beeing asked to really start it but i can guarantee there are no harmless files in the .exe!

# Antivirus
If a Antivirus is blocking the File you need to deactivate or put the file in the whitelist!
The File is only downloading 2 zip files and extract the 2 downloaded files and deletes it after the extracting!
